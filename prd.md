# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name:  
**Pixel Survival: Forest Escape**

## Version:  
1.0  

---

## Overview
**Pixel Survival: Forest Escape** is a web-based pixel art survival game. Players navigate through a forest, collecting essential resources like food, water, and oxygen to survive. As night falls, resources deplete rapidly, pushing the player to find a safe zone to avoid perishing. The objective is to survive as long as possible within a 5-minute game duration.

---

## Objectives
1. Provide a short yet engaging survival experience.
2. Deliver a pixel art aesthetic to appeal to retro and minimalist game lovers.
3. Implement resource collection and time-based survival mechanics.
4. Introduce dynamic gameplay with day-night cycles affecting survival strategies.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Gameplay
- Players must survive for 5 minutes by:
  - Collecting **food**, **water**, and **oxygen** during the day.
  - Reaching a **safe zone** at night to slow resource depletion.
- Resource values will decrease over time:
  - During the day: Slow depletion.
  - At night: Rapid depletion unless in a safe zone.

### 2. Mechanics
- **Resource Collection:**
  - Food, water, and oxygen are scattered throughout the forest.
  - Walking over a resource adds it to the playerâ€™s inventory.
- **Movement:**
  - Players control the character using the keyboard (arrow keys or `WASD`).
- **Day-Night Cycle:**
  - A timer alternates between day (safe) and night (hazardous) cycles.
  - During the night, the screen darkens, and resource depletion speeds up.
- **Game Duration:**
  - Each session lasts 5 minutes.
  - A score is calculated based on the player's survival time and resources collected.

### 3. Visual Design
- **Art Style:** Pixel art, minimalist aesthetics.
  - **Character Sprite:** 16x16 or 32x32 pixel character.
  - **Resources:** Small, distinct sprites for food, water, and oxygen.
  - **Safe Zones:** Unique designs like a cabin or campfire.
  - **Forest:** Trees, rocks, and pathways for a simple yet immersive map.
- **UI:**
  - Resource indicators (food, water, oxygen) displayed at the top.
  - Timer showing the remaining time.

### 4. Map
- Size: Fixed-size forest map, e.g., 800x600 pixels.
- Components:
  - Resources are placed randomly at each game start.
  - At least one safe zone located at a random position.

### 5. Scoring System
- Score calculation:
  - Bonus points for surviving the entire 5 minutes.
  - Points for each unit of resource collected.

### 6. Technical Details
- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Frontend:** HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript for rendering and gameplay.
  - **Backend:** None (single-player, browser-based).
  - **Data Storage:** LocalStorage for saving high scores (optional).
- **Performance:**
  - 60 FPS for smooth gameplay.
  - Minimal resource usage for compatibility with low-end devices.
- **Responsive Design:** Supports desktop and mobile browsers.

## Deliverables
1. A fully functional survival game with:
   - Movement controls.
   - Resource collection mechanics.
   - Day-night cycles affecting gameplay.
2. A pixel art-based forest map with random resource placement.
3. Game duration capped at 5 minutes with a scoring system.
4. Dynamic UI elements for resources, timer, and scores.
